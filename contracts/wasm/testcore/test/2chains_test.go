		// for the request to be placed on the Tangle. This storage deposit in turn
		// will be deposited in the chain2.testcore account on chain1. Any gas fees
		// for the Withdraw() execution will come out if this account as well.

		// WasmLib automatically assumes a minimum of 'WasmStorageDeposit' for storage

		// Note that the accounts.Withdraw() request determines where to withdraw the
		// tokens by looking at the caller. When the caller is an ordinary user, the
		// tokens are withdrawn to that user's associated L1 account. But a contract
		// does not have a L1 address associated with it. Therefore, withdrawal will
		// be done to the contract's L2 account instead. This only makes sense when
		// withdrawing between different chains. Because withdrawal happens *from* the
		// caller's L2 account. So having a contract withdraw from its own L2 account
		// on its own chain is essentially a no-op because it would withdraw *from*
		// its own L2 account *into* its own L2 account.
		// Withdrawing from a contract's L2 account between chains will work, but there
		// are a few issues to take into account.
		// The accounts.Withdraw() function will need to deposit the tokens into the
		// calling contract's L2 account. This it can only do by invoking the same
		// accounts.TransferAllowanceTo() that we used above to deposit tokens into
		// the chain1.coretest account. The Withdraw() function on the other chain will
		// first transfer the allowed tokens into its own account on that chain, and then
		// use a TransferAllowanceTo() request to send them from there to the contract's
		// L2 account on the other chain.
		// This in turn requires a request to be sent to the calling contract's chain by
		// the accounts contract. The tokens that get sent by the accounts contract will
		// be deposited into an account for that contract on the other chain. The amount
		// withdrawn should therefore be >= the necessary storage deposit for that chain,
		// or the request will fail. In addition, the request will need to cover any gas
		// fees required to execute accounts.TransferAllowanceTo() on that chain, and this
		// fee will be taken out of the accounts contract's L2 account on that chain.
		// The issue is that we don't know what these fees will be, so as a temp solution
		// the accounts contract will reserve 'ConstDepositFeeTmp' tokens for this purpose.
		// This value has been set pretty high (1M tokens) to always be able to cover the
		// gas fee. But this means that the remainder, which can be pretty high when gas
		// fees are low, stays locked in the L2 account of the accounts contract on that
		// chain and will be irretrievably lost.
		// So to sum it up, it IS possible for a contract to call accounts.Withdraw(),
		// but it will come at a price of 'ConstDepositFeeTmp' tokens.
